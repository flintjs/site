    <question>
      What can I build with it?
    </question>
    <answer>
      <p>
        Motion has all the power of React, so just about anything!
        We're focusing on making the developer experience as good as possible,
        opening up the community to build and release cool stuff for it.
        Motion is already in use at Zappos, Quixey and a variety of companies
        powering apps, internal tools, and websites.

    <question>
      What are "super" hot reloads?
    </question>
    <answer>
      <p>
        In general, you should see much faster feedback.
        Motion's static analyzer is designed from the ground up to optimize for live development.
        By only injecting the code that you changed into your running app, we can
        provide near-instant reloads no matter how large your app grows. We also track state more accurately than other systems.

    <question>
      Can I use it in my existing stack?
    </question>
    <answer>
      <p>
        Motion is a static compiler and compiles to regular JS, meaning you can  plug it into your existing app as a part of the page. You could also use the syntax within your regular apps with some work.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, many parts of Motion (CLI, build system) work best when it's used alone.
        We're starting by focusing on this, but will be providing more documentation on using Motion in existing applications soon.

    <question>
      What about Flux, GraphQL, or data management?
    </question>
    <answer>
      <p>
        Motion is unopinionated on data management at the moment. You can integrate it with your favorite library, but we are exploring first class solutions for large apps including GraphQL.
      </p>

    <question>What if I decide to stop using Motion</question>
    <answer>
      <p>
        Motion static compiler can output clean code in any framework. We're starting with React.
        At any point you can continue developing from the code we output if you choose to stop using Motion.
